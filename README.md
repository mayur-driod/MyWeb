# MyWebPage
 Still a work in progress... A Vite x React project for me to enhance my React skills
 -
 I have always wanted to create a portfolio, so this is one step towards achieving that goal.
 This page is purely built on React so I can integrate the functionality of the page very easily.


 This page mainly focuses on two of my main interests which are photography and software. So I have integrated a toggle button that allows users to switch between the two and view both of my passions.
