    <h1>Hey I am Mayur</h1>
    <p>I am Mayur and I have two main intrests in life. First one is Software and Computers while the other is Photography. I wanted to showcase my 
      knowledge and skills in both these aspects so I created this webpage. This webpage is designed in such a way that when you toggle the button to
      software it shows everything about my journey with software and computers and when I toggle it to Photography it shows me everything about Photography.
